Flutter is back at Google I/O on May 19-20![Register now](https://io.google/2026/?utm_source=flutter&utm_medium=embedded_marketing&utm_campaign=flutter)

## Add-to-app

If you are writing a new application from scratch, it is easy to[get started](https://docs.flutter.dev/learn/pathway)using Flutter. But what if you already have an app that's not written in
                  Flutter, and it's impractical to start from scratch?

For those situations, Flutter can be integrated into your existing application
                  piecemeal, as a module. This feature is known as "add-to-app". The module can be
                  imported into your existing app to render part of your app using Flutter, while
                  the rest can be rendered using existing technology. This method can also be used
                  to run shared non-UI logic by taking advantage of Dart's portability and
                  interoperability with other languages.

Add-to-app is currently supported on Android, iOS, and web.

Flutter supports two flavors of add-to-app:

- **Multi-engine**: supported on Android and iOS, allows running one or more
                    instances of Flutter, each rendering a widget embedded into the host
                    application. Each instance is a separate Dart program, running in isolation
                    from other programs. Having multiple Flutter instances allows each instance to
                    maintain independent application and UI state while using minimal memory
                    resources. See more in the[multiple Flutters](https://docs.flutter.dev/add-to-app/multiple-flutters)page.
- **Multi-view**: supported on the web, allows creating multiple[FlutterView](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/dart-ui/FlutterView-class.html)s, each rendering a widget embedded into the host application.
                    In this mode there's only one Dart program and all views and widgets can share
                    objects.

Add-to-app supports integrating multiple Flutter views of any size, supporting
                  various use-cases. Two of the most common use-cases are:

- **Hybrid navigation stacks**: an app is made of multiple screens, some of
                    which are rendered by Flutter, and others by another framework. The user can
                    navigate from one screen to another freely, no matter which framework is used
                    to render the screen.
- **Partial-screen views**: a screen in the app renders multiple widgets, some
                    of which are rendered by Flutter, and others by another framework. The user
                    can scroll and interact with any widget freely, no matter which framework is
                    used to render the widget.

## Supported features

### Add to Android applications

- Auto-build and import the Flutter module by adding a
                    Flutter SDK hook to your Gradle script.
- Build your Flutter module into a generic[Android Archive (AAR)](https://developer.android.com/studio/projects/android-library)for integration into your
                    own build system and for better Jetifier interoperability
                    with AndroidX.
- [FlutterEngine](https://api.flutter.dev/javadoc/io/flutter/embedding/engine/FlutterEngine.html)API for starting and persisting
                    your Flutter environment independently of attaching a[FlutterActivity](https://api.flutter.dev/javadoc/io/flutter/embedding/android/FlutterActivity.html)/[FlutterFragment](https://api.flutter.dev/javadoc/io/flutter/embedding/android/FlutterFragment.html)etc.
- Android Studio Android/Flutter co-editing and module
                    creation/import wizard.
- Java and Kotlin host apps are supported.
- Flutter modules can use[Flutter plugins](https://pub.dev/flutter)to interact
                    with the platform.
- Support for Flutter debugging and stateful hot reload by
                    using`flutter attach`from IDEs or the command line to
                    connect to an app that contains Flutter.

`FlutterEngine`
`FlutterActivity`
`FlutterFragment`
`flutter attach`
### Add to iOS applications

- Auto-build and import the Flutter module by adding a Flutter
                    SDK hook to your CocoaPods and to your Xcode build phase.
- Build your Flutter module into a generic[iOS Framework](https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/MacOSX/Conceptual/BPFrameworks/Concepts/WhatAreFrameworks.html)for integration into your own build system.
- [FlutterEngine](https://api.flutter.dev/ios-embedder/interface_flutter_engine.html)API for starting and persisting
                    your Flutter environment independently of attaching a[FlutterViewController](https://api.flutter.dev/ios-embedder/interface_flutter_view_controller.html).
- Objective-C and Swift host apps supported.
- Flutter modules can use[Flutter plugins](https://pub.dev/flutter)to interact
                    with the platform.
- Support for Flutter debugging and stateful hot reload by
                    using`flutter attach`from IDEs or the command line to
                    connect to an app that contains Flutter.

`FlutterEngine`
`FlutterViewController`
`flutter attach`
See our[add-to-app GitHub Samples repository](https://github.com/flutter/samples/tree/main/add_to_app)for sample projects in Android and iOS that import
                  a Flutter module for UI.

### Add to web applications

Flutter can be added to any existing HTML DOM-based web app written in any
                  client-side Dart web framework ([jaspr](https://pub.dev/packages/jaspr),[ngdart](https://pub.dev/packages/ngdart),[over_react](https://pub.dev/packages/over_react), etc),
                  any client-side JS framework ([React](https://react.dev/),[Angular](https://angular.dev/),[Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/), etc),
                  any server-side rendered framework ([Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/),[Ruby on Rails](https://rubyonrails.org/),[Apache Struts](https://struts.apache.org/), etc), or even no framework (affectionately known as
                  "[VanillaJS](http://vanilla-js.com/)"). The minimum requirement is only that your existing application
                  and its framework support importing JavaScript libraries, and creating HTML
                  elements for Flutter to render into.

To add Flutter to an existing app, build it normally, then follow the[embedding instructions](https://docs.flutter.dev/platform-integration/web/embedding-flutter-web#embedded-mode)for putting Flutter views onto the page.

## Get started

To get started, see our project integration guide for
                  Android and iOS:

## API usage

After Flutter is integrated into your project,
                  see our API usage guides at the following links:

## Limitations

Mobile limitations:

- Multi-view mode is not supported (multi-engine only).
- Packing multiple Flutter libraries into an
                    application isn't supported.
- Plugins that don't support`FlutterPlugin`might have unexpected
                    behaviors if they make assumptions that are untenable in add-to-app
                    (such as assuming that a Flutter`Activity`is always present).
- On Android, the Flutter module only supports AndroidX applications.

`FlutterPlugin`
`Activity`
Web limitations:

- Multi-engine mode is not supported (multi-view only).
- There's no way to completely "shutdown" the Flutter engine. The app can remove
                    all the[FlutterView](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/dart-ui/FlutterView-class.html)objects and make sure all data is garbage collected
                    using normal Dart concepts. However, the engine will remain warmed up, even if
                    it's not rendering anything.
