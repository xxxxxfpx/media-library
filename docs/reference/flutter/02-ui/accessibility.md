Flutter is back at Google I/O on May 19-20![Register now](https://io.google/2026/?utm_source=flutter&utm_medium=embedded_marketing&utm_campaign=flutter)

## Background

Ensuring that apps are accessible to a broad range of users is an essential
                  part of building a high-quality app. Applications that are poorly
                  designed create barriers to people of all ages. The[UN Convention on
                    the Rights of Persons with Disabilities](https://social.desa.un.org/issues/disability/crpd/article-9-accessibility)states the moral and legal
                  imperative to ensure universal access to information systems; countries
                  around the world enforce accessibility as a requirement; and companies
                  recognize the business advantages of maximizing access to their services.

We strongly encourage you to include an accessibility checklist
                  as a key criteria before shipping your app. Flutter is committed to
                  supporting developers in making their apps more accessible, and includes
                  first-class framework support for accessibility in addition to that
                  provided by the underlying operating system, including:

## Accessibility regulations

Accessibility standards and regulations help ensure that products are
                  accessible to people with disabilities. Many of these have been enacted into
                  laws and policies, making them requirements for products and services.


**WCAG 2**:[Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2](https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/wcag/)is an
                      internationally recognized standard for making web content more accessible
                      to people with disabilities. It is a stable, technical standard developed
                      by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C).

**EN 301 549**:[EN 301 549](https://www.etsi.org/deliver/etsi_en/301500_301599/301549/03.02.01_60/en_301549v030201p.pdf)is the European harmonized standard for
                      accessibility requirements for Information and Communication Technology (ICT)
                      products and services.

**VPAT**: The[Voluntary Product Accessibility Template (VPAT)](https://www.itic.org/policy/accessibility/vpat)is a
                      free template that translates accessibility requirements and standards into
                       actionable testing criteria for products and services.

Laws around the world require digital content and services to be accessible
                  to people with disabilities.
                  In the U.S., the[Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA)](https://www.ada.gov/)prohibits
                  discrimination in public accommodations.[Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act](https://www.section508.gov/)requires federal agencies and their
                  contractors to meet WCAG standards for all ICT.

In the EU, the[European Accessibility Act (EAA)](https://commission.europa.eu/strategy-and-policy/policies/justice-and-fundamental-rights/disability/union-equality-strategy-rights-persons-disabilities-2021-2030/european-accessibility-act_en)requires a wide range of
                  public and private sector services to be accessible, primarily using
                  the[EN 301 549](https://www.etsi.org/deliver/etsi_en/301500_301599/301549/03.02.01_60/en_301549v030201p.pdf)as its technical basis.

## Building with accessibility in mind

Ensuring that your app can be used by everyone means building accessibility
                  into it from the start. For some apps, that's easier said than done.
                  In the video below, two of our engineers take a mobile app from a dire
                  accessibility state to one that takes advantage of Flutter's built-in
                  widgets to offer a dramatically more accessible experience.

## Accessibility release checklist

Here is a non-exhaustive list of things to consider as you prepare your
                  app for release.

- **Active interactions**. Ensure that all active interactions do
                    something. Any button that can
                    be pushed should do something when pushed. For example, if you have a
                    no-op callback for an`onPressed`event, change it to show a`SnackBar`on the screen explaining which control you just pushed.
- **Screen reader testing**. The screen reader should be able to
                    describe all controls on the page when you tap on them, and the
                    descriptions should be intelligible. Test your app with[TalkBack](https://support.google.com/accessibility/android/answer/6283677?hl=en)(Android) and[VoiceOver](https://www.apple.com/lae/accessibility/iphone/vision/)(iOS).
- **Contrast ratios**. We encourage you to have a contrast ratio of at
                    least 4.5:1 between controls or text and the background, with the
                    exception of disabled components. Images should also be vetted for
                    sufficient contrast.
- **Context switching**. Nothing should change the user's context
                    automatically while typing in information. Generally, the widgets
                    should avoid changing the user's context without some sort of
                    confirmation action.
- **Tappable targets**. All tappable targets should be at least 48x48 pixels.
- **Errors**. Important actions should be able to be undone. In fields
                    that show errors, suggest a correction if possible.
- **Color vision deficiency testing**. Controls should be usable and
                    legible in colorblind and grayscale modes.
- **Scale factors**. The UI should remain legible and usable at very
                    large scale factors for text size and display scaling.
